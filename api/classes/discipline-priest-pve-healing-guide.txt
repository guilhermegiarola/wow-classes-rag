# Discipline Priest Guide — The War Within (11.2.5)

## 1. CLASS OVERVIEW

### Class/Spec Name and Role
- **Class/Spec Name**: Discipline Priest
- **Role**: Healer (with DPS capabilities)

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths**:
- High burst healing on a short cooldown.
- Strong cooldowns that increase the effective health of your group (through absorbs or damage reduction).
- Provides significant damage with low opportunity cost.
- Strong tools for both group wide and single target healing in a Mythic Plus environment.

**Weaknesses**:
- Reactive, raid-wide, emergency heals are limited compared to other healing specs.
- Mistakes made by the Discipline Priest are far more punishing than on other healers.
- High barrier to entry for raid healing.
- Poor personal mobility options.
- One of only two specializations without access to an interrupt.

### When to Play This Spec
- Effective in both raid and Mythic+ environments.
- Ideal for players who enjoy a proactive healing playstyle, balancing damage dealing with healing.

### Playstyle Description
Discipline Priests have a unique playstyle that revolves around healing through dealing damage due to the Atonement passive ability. This means they can contribute to raid damage output while simultaneously healing. Mastering this balance takes practice but can lead to rewarding gameplay.
