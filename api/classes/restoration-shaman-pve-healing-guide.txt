## CLASS OVERVIEW

### Class/Spec Name and Role
- **Class/Spec**: Restoration Shaman
- **Role**: Healer

### Strengths and Weaknesses
#### Strengths:
- Can often cast while moving with **Spiritwalker's Grace** and quickly reposition with **Gust of Wind**.
- Unique support tools: **Ancestral Vigor**, **Spirit Link Totem**, and **Ancestral Protection Totem**.
- Great healing capability, especially in spread situations with no-healing rain builds.
- Excellent survivability with abilities like **Astral Shift**, **Earth Elemental**, **Stone Bulwark Totem**, and passives such as **Brimming with Life**.
- Solid non-healing capabilities, including **Skyfury**, **Reincarnation**, and various utility totems.

#### Weaknesses:
- Non-cooldown healing is mana inefficient or tied to high cast times.
- Lacks tank cooldowns beyond **Spirit Link Totem**, which has a long cooldown.
- Limited passive damage increase outside of **Acid Rain**, which is dependent on **Healing Rain** casts.
- No teleport abilities or damage immunities; **Reincarnation** has a long cooldown.

### When to Play This Spec
- Ideal when healing groups of clumped players in both raids and Mythic+ dungeons.
- Especially effective in handling unexpected and significant damage influx.

### Playstyle Description
The Restoration Shaman plays a flexible healing role, mainly using cooldown abilities like **Riptide**, **Healing Rain**, and **Chain Heal** strategically rather than following a fixed rotation. The playstyle revolves around reacting to group damage and adapting spell usage based on incoming threat levels while maintaining good mana management.

## ROTATION & ABILITIES

### Complete Priority Rotation
1. **Set Cloudburst Totem** ahead of incoming damage.
2. **Cast Unleash Life** followed by **Ancestral Swiftness** to enhance your next spell's healing.
3. **Cast Riptide** on cooldown to build **Tidal Waves**.
4. **Use Chain Heal** when multiple allies are damaged.
5. **Heal** single-targets with **Healing Surge**, using **Master of the Elements** when possible.
6. **DPS** using **Lava Burst** when healing is unnecessary.

### Exact Cooldown Usage and Timing
- **Cloudburst Totem**: Always cast on cooldown unless timing for a specific damage phase.
- **Ancestral Swiftness**: Use preferably prior to large damage events to maximize the healing output.
- **Healing Tide Totem**: Utilize as a baseline healing cooldown when grouped with allies.

### Single Target Rotation (Detailed Step-by-Step)
1. Apply **Riptide** to the target.
2. Use **Healing Surge** as needed, prioritizing the **Master of the Elements** buff.
3. Ensure **Tidal Waves** and **Ancestral Swiftness** are up for optimal healing output.

### AoE/Cleave Rotation (Detailed Step-by-Step)
1. **Set Cloudburst Totem** ahead of time.
2. Use **Healing Rain** to heal and trigger **Acid Rain** bonuses.
3. Cast **Chain Heal** whenever multiple targets are injured.
4. Use **Unleash Life** before **Chain Heal** for increased healing.

### Opening Rotation/Opener Sequence
1. **Water Shield** and **Earth Shield** yourself and the tank before the encounter starts.
2. At the pull, immediately cast **Riptide**, followed by **Healing Rain**, and then **Cloudburst Totem** if expecting a burst of damage.

| **Chain Heal**                  | Heals multiple targets; bonuses increase healing based on buffs.           | No cooldown         | 0 mana         |
| **Cloudburst Totem**            | Absorbs healing for later release.                                         | 120 seconds        | 0 mana         |

### Ability Interactions and Synergies
- **Riptide** enhances the effectiveness of **Chain Heal** when multiple targets are injured due to **Tidal Waves** mechanic.
- Utilize **Ancestral Swiftness** before **Riptide** to amplify the follow-up healing spells.
- **Cloudburst Totem** enables recovery of healing spent earlier in damage phases.

### Rotation Conditionals
- Use **Chain Heal** if multiple allies are injured; otherwise, focus on single-target healing with **Healing Surge**.
- Save **Cloudburst Totem** for high damage periods for maximum return on healing.

### Resource Management (Runes, Runic Power, etc.)
- Maintain **Mana** sustainability through effective usage of utility spells during downtime.
- Monitor your **Tidal Waves** stacks to optimize the timing on **Riptide** and **Healing Surge** casts.
