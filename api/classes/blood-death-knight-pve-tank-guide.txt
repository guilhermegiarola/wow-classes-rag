## ROTATION & ABILITIES

### Complete priority rotation
1. Pre-place **Death and Decay** where you will be fighting.
2. Pull from range with **Death's Caress**.
3. Use **Blooddrinker**.
4. Use **Dancing Rune Weapon** during the last 0.75 seconds of **Blooddrinker**.
5. Cast **Blood Boil** to pandemic **Blood Plague** to its maximum value and apply two copies from **Dancing Rune Weapon**.
6. Press **Bonestorm**.
7. Cast **Death Strike** if above 35 Runic Power, otherwise use **Vampiric Strike**, until 4 seconds left on **Dancing Rune Weapon**.
8. Continue casting **Death Strike** or **Vampiric Strike** until **Dancing Rune Weapon** fades.
9. Cast **Consumption** with 4 seconds left on **Dancing Rune Weapon**.
10. Continue casting **Vampiric Strike** unless you have enough Runic Power for **Death Strike**.
11. If there are more than 4 targets, use **Death and Decay** if not buffed.
12. Press **Heart Strike**.
13. Press **Tombstone**.

### Exact cooldown usage and timing
- Use cooldowns (like **Dancing Rune Weapon**) primarily for resource generation, peaking your DPS, and survivability.
  
### Single target rotation
- Refer to the complete priority rotation above, adjusted for single target (if you are solely focused on one boss).

### AoE/cleave rotation
- As above, but prioritize **Death and Decay** more after applying **Blood Boil** to as many targets as possible, and be sure to trigger **Crimson Scourge** for additional **Death and Decay** usage.

### Opening rotation/opener sequence
- Same steps as described in the complete rotation, from the pre-placed **Death and Decay** at pull to the execution of your cooldowns.

### Key abilities with their effects, cooldowns, and resource costs
- **Death Strike**
  - Effect: Heals you based on damage taken in the last 5 seconds.
  - Resource Cost: Runic Power.
  
- **Dancing Rune Weapon**
  - Effect: Grants a 35% chance to parry, increases damage, and resource generation.
  - Cooldown: 1 minute.

- **Blooddrinker**
  - Effect: Channels to heal and forms a connection to the target.
  - Cooldown: 1.5 minutes.

- **Anti-Magic Shell**
  - Effect: Absorbs magic damage up to 30% of maximum health.
  - Cooldown: 45 seconds.

- **Vampiric Blood**
  - Effect: Increases maximum health and healing received by 30%.
  - Cooldown: 1.5 minutes.

- **Icebound Fortitude**
  - Effect: Reduces all damage taken by 30% for 8 seconds, immune to stuns.
  - Cooldown: 8 minutes.

### Ability interactions and synergies
- **Tombstone**: Should be used when **Dancing Rune Weapon** is on cooldown and you have 6+ Bone Shield charges.
- **Bonestorm**: Should be used strategically along with **Tombstone** and **Death and Decay** for optimal generation from both abilities.

### Rotation conditionals (when to use what)
- **Use Death Strike** when health is low or when approaching maximum Runic Power.
- **Marrowrend** when Bone Shield charges are low (5 or fewer).
- **Consumption** is prioritized for Runic Power efficiency.

### Resource management
- **Runes**: Six total, consuming a rune generates 10 Runic Power.
- **Runic Power**: Max is 125 (145 with **Rune of Hysteria**). Vital to not let it cap and to efficiently use it with **Death Strike**.

## ADDITIONAL INFO

### Tips and tricks
- Always be mindful of both your cooldowns and how to chain abilities effectively for maximum survivability.
- Utilize **Death Strike** wisely—don't let Runic Power cap.

### Common mistakes
- Overlapping **Blooddrinker** and **Dancing Rune Weapon** can lead to poor resource generation.
- Failing to pre-place **Death and Decay** can hinder your opener effectiveness.

### Macros
- Use macros to combine **Death Grip** with **Death's Caress** for quick taunting and pulling.

### Addons
- Addons that track your cooldowns and resource generation can aid significantly in optimizing your performance in raids and dungeons.

### Any other relevant information
- The new Combat Assistant mode has limitations that can significantly impact the performance of a Blood Death Knight post-cast and should be approached cautiously for tanking roles.
