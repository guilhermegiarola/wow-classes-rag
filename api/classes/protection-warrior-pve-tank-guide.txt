### Ability Interactions and Synergies
- **Execute** can reset Shield Slam cooldown if the target's health is below 20%.
- Use Thunder Clap early to generate threat and Deep Wounds before switching to Shield Slam.

### Rotation Conditionals
- Use Ignore Pain if at risk of capping Rage or if engaging with significant damage.
- Cast Shield Slam when available; it can be reset by certain actions such as using Revenge.

### Resource Management
- **Rage** decays at 1 per second when out of combat, but not when fighting.
- Max capacity of Rage is 100. Managing Rage is crucial to prevent waste.
