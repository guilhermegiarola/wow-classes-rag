## ADDITIONAL INFO

### Tips and Tricks
- Learning the mechanics of each boss fight can help manage your cooldowns better.
- Always check positioning for **Consecration** placement; losing uptime leads to increased damage intake.

### Common Mistakes
- Allowing **Holy Power** to cap while generating more can lead to a loss in potential mitigation from **Shield of the Righteous**.
- Forgetting to reapply **Consecration** can significantly reduce your damage reduction.

### Macros
- **Divine Shield Cancellation Macro:**
  ```plaintext
  #showtooltip
  /cast Divine Shield

### Addons
- Recommended addons include WeakAuras for tracking buffs/debuffs and threat plates for managing threat levels.

### Any Other Relevant Information
- The **Combat Assistant** mode can automate rotation but has significant drawbacks including DPS loss and inadequate defensive play; thus it's recommended to use the traditional method of control.
